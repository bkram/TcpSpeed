The enclosed program can be used to measure the TCP throughput of a TCP
channel between two machines.


Usage:

On one machine start "tcpspeed s" (the server).

On the other machine start "tcpspeed c <hostname>", where <hostname> is the
name of the machine running the server.

The client will received 20 MB of data from the server, and then calculate
and display the throughput.


Technical information:

An AmigaOS binary and the (reasonably portable) source code are are included.
The port number and the amount of data transfered are adjustable.

If your OS uses old-style (BSD 4.2) sockaddr_in structures (as, e.g. Linux),
then you need to comment out the line
"#define HASSINLEN".

The program relies on the function "times()" to measure the elapsed time. In
AmigaOS "clock()" is used instead, because sc.lib does not have "times()".

DO NOT use "clock()" in Unix, because in Unix that function measures used CPU
time, not elapsed overall time. If your Unix dialect does not have "times()"
then use some other function that measures elapsed time with an accuracy of
at least 1 ms.

           The source has been a bit changed by Simone "Wiz" Tellini
           <wiz@vapor.com> to allow a Win32 compile. The new source and the
           executable, tcpspeed.exe, are now included!
           The original src is into "oldsrc"
